Let me explain what you have downloaded in the project.zip file. This is a Vite-based decentralized application (dApp) that includes:

    Frontend (in /client folder):
        React components for wallet connection and smart contract interaction
        MetaMask integration with Sepolia testnet support
        A clean UI with input forms for int256 and string values
        Real-time value display and update functionality

    Smart Contract (in /contracts folder):
        Storage.sol: A simple Solidity contract that stores and manages:
            An int256 number
            A string text value
            Functions to get and set these values

    Configuration Files:
        Environment setup for contract address
        Vite and TypeScript configurations
        Tailwind CSS styling setup

What you'll need to do next:

    Get some Sepolia testnet ETH (from a faucet)
    Deploy your smart contract to get a contract address
    Set the contract address in the environment variables
    Start the application
